Using VICE: Visual and Interactive Computing Environment
========================================================

CyVerse introduces VICE (Visual Interactive Computing Environment), an extension to the CyVerse `Discovery Environment (DE) <https://www.cyverse.org/discovery-environment>`_.
It enables users to launch modern data science Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) including Project Jupyter, RStudio, and Shiny, without having to download data or move to another platform to analyze the results from analysis workflows. 
As a fully integrated piece of the CyVerse data management platform, VICE handles transferring data and returning the results back to the Data Store for you securely.

This is a work-in-progress. `Detailed documentation <https://cyverse-visual-interactive-computing-environment.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/index.html>`_ can be found in our Learning Center.
