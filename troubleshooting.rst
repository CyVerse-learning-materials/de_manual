Troubleshooting and Getting Help with the Discovery Environment
===============================================================

There are lots of ways to get help with the DE. This page lists the places to start.

Start here
----------

Within the DE, simply click |help_icon| at the top right of the screen, and then click FAQs to view the list of frequently asked questions, Forum to go to the Ask CyVerse forum, or Feedback to contact Support or provide feedback about the DE.

Is the DE down?
---------------

From time to time, the Discovery Environment is taken down for updates, maintenance releases, or other reasons. The `CyVerse Maintenance Calendar <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ceg65s6grs4kgt45ifpr3qpsk8%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Phoenix>`_ lists the upcoming maintenance periods, so check there first.

In addition, a banner will be displayed in this manual before the maintenance window to notify you of the affected services, CyVerse's newsletter, *The Node*, lists upcoming maintenance windows, and you will receive an email prior to the downtime.

Can't log in, need to reset your password, or don't remember your CyVerse username?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See `Resetting Your Password. <http://www.cyverse.org/learning-center/manage-account#ResetPassword>`_

Stuck in Loading or a window is "stuck"?
----------------------------------------

You can use the keyboard shortcut to close active windows. Unless you changed your `default preference <https://cyverse-de-manual.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/using_DEchildpages/using-preferences-menu.html>`_, the shortcut is **Ctrl + Shift + Q**.
