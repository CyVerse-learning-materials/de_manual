About downloading files and folders
-----------------------------------

You can download data items from another CyVerse user to your computer using either simple download, or using `Cyberduck <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DS/Using+Cyberduck+for+Uploading+and+Downloading+to+the+Data+Store>`_ to do a bulk download. 
You can also download data items outside the DE; some methods allow download without a CyVerse user account. For more information, see `Downloading and Uploading Data <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DS/Downloading+and+Uploading+Data>`_ and `Downloading Data Files Without a User Account <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DS/Downloading+Data+Files+Without+a+User+Account>`_.

- **Simple download** allows you to download single or multiple files (but not folders), and does not require any external app installation or configuration. 
- **Bulk download** allows you to download multiple files and folders, and requires installation and configuration of `Cyberduck <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DS/Using+Cyberduck+for+Uploading+and+Downloading+to+the+Data+Store>`_ (recommended).

In addition, you can use `iDrop Desktop <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DS/Using+iDrop+Desktop>`_ to upload and download data files outside of the DE, download a file via a `data link <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DEmanual/Sharing+Data+Files+Via+Public+Links>`_ that was shared by another CyVerse user, and `upload and import data files <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DEmanual/Uploading+and+Importing+Data+Items+Within+the+DE>`_.

Other Access Methods
--------------------

For a comparison of the different methods ofm uploading and downloading data items, see `Downloading and Uploading data <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DS/Downloading+and+Uploading+Data>`_.

            a. Click the first file link, browse to the folder location, and click **Save**.
            b. Repeat for each file to download.

About bulk download
-------------------

The `Cyberduck <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DS/Using+Cyberduck+for+Uploading+and+Downloading+to+the+Data+Store>`_ application, which requires installation and configuration, is the recommended method for bulk transfer of files for Mac and Windows users. It replaces the iDrop Lite Java applet and iDrop, and is available for Mac OS and Windows. LINUX users should continue to use iCommands or iDrop Desktop instead. 

In addition to Cyberduck, you may still download files and folders within the DE using `simple download <https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/DEmanual/Downloading+Files+and+Folders>`_, or upload or import files within the DE using `simple upload or import from URL <https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/DEmanual/Uploading+and+Importing+Data+Items+Within+the+DE>`_. You may also use `iCommands <https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/DS/Using+iCommands>`_.
**The method you use depends on the size and number of your data files, as well as your personal preferences. For a comparison of the different methods of uploading and downloading data items both within and outside the DE, see** `Downloading and Uploading Data <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DS/Downloading+and+Uploading+Data>`_.


About anonymous download (accessing data without a CyVerse account)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Users who do not have a CyVerse account can download certain data files using an anonymous login. For more information, see `Downloading Data Files Without a User Account <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DS/Downloading+Data+Files+Without+a+User+Account>`_.
