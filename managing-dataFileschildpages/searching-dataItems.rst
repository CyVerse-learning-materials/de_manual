Searching for Data Items
------------------------

You can do a basic query for a data file or folder in the Data window search field, or create a more specific advanced one.

Advanced search features include the ability to search for included or excluded words in the file or folder name, date created or last modified, metadata attributes and values, owner, shared recipients, file size, tags, and items in the Trash. You also can . You also can save an advanced search for later reuse, and include items in the Trash folder.

Within the search query, you can use wildcards * (asterisk, which returns any character sequence) and ? (question mark returns any single character sequence) to widen your search. Note that you cannot start the query with a wildcard.

Once you have the search where you want it, you can save it as a filter name for future reuse. Saved filters are displayed at the bottom of your Navigation list under the filter name. Clicking the filter executes the search with the same settings. You can edit a filter and execute it one time only or save it as a new filter, as well as delete a filter.

Before you begin, you may want to watch a `YouTube video on advanced data search <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoTYqPllZrI>`_.

| **Not getting the search results you expect?** |
+------------------------------------------------+
| If you are not seeing expected search results, | 
| be aware that it may take a few minutes for any| 
| changes to a data file or folder – such as new |
| upload, delete, rename, or update – to be      |
| reflected in search results.                   |
