You can upload and import files from your desktop using several different methods:

.. image:: img/DataUploadMenu.jpg

    - **Simple Upload from Desktop**: Useful for uploading smaller files of up to 1.9 GB per file.
    - **Bulk upload from Desktop**: Upload multiple files using `Cyberduck <https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/DS/Using+Cyberduck+for+Uploading+and+Downloading+to+the+Data+Store>`_.
    - **Import From URL**: Allows you to past a URL to the file to upload. 


Network bandwidth and current load impacts upload times. For more information on larger files and allocations, see `Downloading and Uploading Data <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DS/Downloading+and+Uploading+Data>`_.

You can also `import files from URL <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DEmanual/Uploading+and+Importing+Data+Items+Within+the+DE#UploadingandImportingDataItemsWithintheDE-importURL>`_ that are larger than 3-4 GB or are not on your computer.

    6. Repeat for each file to upload. 
    7. Click **Upload**. The files are uploaded to the destination folder. 


Using Bulk Upload from Desktop
------------------------------

Mac and Windows should us `Cyberduck <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DS/Using+Cyberduck+for+Uploading+and+Downloading+to+the+Data+Store>`_ for downloading bulk files, where Linux users may want to use `iDrop Desktop <https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/DS/Using+iDrop+Desktop>`_ or `iCommands <https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/DS/Using+iCommands>`_.
You also may still upload or import files within the DE using `simple upload or import from URL <https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/DEmanual/Uploading+and+Importing+Data+Items+Within+the+DE>`_ within the DE. The method you use depends on the size and number of your data files, as well as your personal preferences. 

You can access and manage data from outside the DE as well. For more information, see `Downloading and Uploading Data <https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/DS/Downloading+and+Uploading+Data>`_.

Importing From URL
------------------

Use Import from URL when you want to import larger files, have some files you want to upload from desktop and some you want to import from URL, or want to import a file to the DE that isn't on your system. 
You can receive (or not receive) an email when the status of your imported data item changes. See `Using the Preferences Menu <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DEmanual/Using+the+Preferences+Menu>`_ for more information.



    1. Copy the URL for the first file to import. 
    2. In your personal folder, select the destination folder for the import. (To create a new folder, see `Create a Folder <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DEmanual/Uploading+and+Importing+Data+Items+Within+the+DE#UploadingandImportingDataItemsWithintheDE-createFolder>.`_ 
    3. Click **Upload** and then click **Import from URL**.

    5. Repeat for each file to import. 
    6. Click the **Import from URL** button. The files are imported to the destination folder.

**Password Help**

    - If you are importing from an FTP URL that requires authentication, be sure to include your FTP username and password (not your CyVerse username and password) in the URL, as described `here <https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~watrous/user-pass-url.html>`_. 
    - If your password contains special characters, you may have to `convert to percent encoding <https://www3.trustwave.com/support/kb/article.aspx?id=14938>`_ first.
