====================================
Using Data Tags and Tag Descriptions
====================================


You can add a unique tag to any file or folder to help categorize or identify its contents. Although technically a tag is a form of metadata, your tags list is specific only to your Data list and cannot be viewed by other users, even if the data item has been shared, unlike with metadata.

When you add a tag, a list of suggestions from previous tags in any file or folder in your Data list is displayed, if a match has been found; you can select one of the existing tags or enter a new one.

After adding a tag, you can enter a description to provide additional information about the tag or data item, and `search files and folders for matching tags. <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DEmanual/Searching+for+Data+Items>`_



Adding or selecting a tag
-------------------------

Your list of tags is available only to you; adding or deleting a tag does not affect the file for other users who have sharing access to it.

    1. In the Data window, `find and select the file or folder <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DEmanual/Searching+for+Data+Items>`_ you want to tag.
    2. In the **Tags** field in the Details pane, enter the tag to use.
    3. As you type, a list of suggested tags may be displayed.
       To select a tag from the list, select the tag to use.
    4. To enter a new tag, enter the tag and press **Return**.
       When the tag is attached to the file, it is displayed below the search field in an orange box:

Deleting a tag
--------------

When you delete a tag, it is only removed from the file or folder but remains available in your list.

    1. `Select the file or folder <https://wiki.cyverse.org/wiki/display/DEmanual/Searching+for+Data+Items>`_ with the tag to delete.
    2. In the **Tags** field in the Details pane, hover over the tag to delete until the edit panel is displayed:

Entering and editing tag descriptions 
-------------------------------------
