==================================
**Managing Data Files and Folder**
==================================

The Data window contains both input data files that are used in analyses and output data files that are returned as the result of completed analyses. 
Input data files can be uploaded or imported to your personal workspace from your desktop or from URL, as well as made available by other users in the Community Data folder and shared with others.

This section discusses how to organize and maneuver data files and folders in your Data window, including viewing and changing the file's info-type.

For information on using data files in your analyses, see Submitting an Analysis.

You can access and manage data from outside the DE as well. For more information, see Downloading and Uploading Data.
