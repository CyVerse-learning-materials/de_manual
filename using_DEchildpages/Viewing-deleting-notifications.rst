**Using the DE: Viewing and Deleting Notifications**
----------------------------------------------------

Notifications are status updates about the requests for import or uploaded data files or folders, the progression of a submitted analysis, the status of `shared data items <https://cyverse-doi-request-quickstart.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/>`_. Up to 10 unread notifications are displayed in the short list, and you can filter by new, all, analysis, data, or tool request notifications, and delete some or all notifications.

In addition to notifications in the Notifications menu, you can set the preference to recieve an email notification when the status of a submitted analysis or URL import changes.

**Viewing notifications**

To view the list of up to 10 unread notifications, click |notificationsicon| at the top right of the screen. 

   - To view more information about a request for a new tool or DOI, click the notification. 

   - To review the results of an analysis, click the analysis name in the notification. 

Click **See all notifications** to open the **first page** of up to 10 notifications in the Notifications window. If no unread notifications are available, **See all notifications** will not be displayed.

   - To filter by only new, all, data, or analysis notifications, click the drop-down list on the top left of the window and select the notification filter type.
